Real-World Scenarios for Factory Pattern

    Notification Systems
        A notification service may need to send different types of notifications (e.g., Email, SMS, Push). The Factory Pattern lets you encapsulate the logic of creating these notifications based on the type.

    Payment Gateways
        A payment processing system might support multiple payment methods (Credit Card, PayPal, Google Pay). The factory decides which implementation to instantiate based on the userâ€™s selection.

    UI Components
        In GUI applications, different types of dialog boxes, buttons, or forms may need to be created dynamically based on the platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).

    Data Access Layer
        A factory can create different types of database connections (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) depending on the configuration or context.


Benefits of Using Factory Pattern

    Encapsulation of Object Creation Logic:
    The client code does not need to know about the specific classes or their constructors.

    Ease of Maintenance:
    Adding new types of objects becomes straightforward. You only modify the factory, leaving the client code untouched.

    Promotes Code Reusability:
    Reuse the factory for similar object creation logic across the application.

    Flexibility and Scalability:
    Makes it easier to add, modify, or extend the types of objects your application can create.
