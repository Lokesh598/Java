"The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows us to create new objects by cloning an existing object, called the prototype. This is useful when object creation is costly or complex, and we need to create multiple similar objects."

Explain when it's useful:

"It is used when creating objects from scratch is expensive or when we want to avoid creating multiple subclasses just for object creation. For example, in a graphic design application, we can clone existing shapes like circles or rectangles to create similar shapes with slight modifications."
