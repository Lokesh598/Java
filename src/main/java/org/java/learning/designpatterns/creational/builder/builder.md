Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. Unlike other patterns, the Builder pattern focuses on creating a complex object by separating its construction process from its representation. It allows you to create different types and configurations of an object using the same construction process.

Key Characteristics of Builder Pattern

    Step-by-Step Construction: Constructs an object in a step-by-step approach.
    Complex Object Creation: Useful when the object has multiple optional attributes or requires a specific sequence of construction steps.
    Immutability: The final object is often immutable after construction.
    Readable Code: Makes the construction process more readable and manageable.

When to Use Builder Pattern

    Complex Objects with Many Parameters:
    When a class has many attributes, some of which are optional, the Builder pattern avoids telescoping constructors (constructors with many parameters).

    Immutable Objects:
    Useful for creating objects that are immutable, such as in scenarios requiring thread-safety.

    Object with Various Configurations:
    When you need to create an object with different configurations or representations based on specific use cases.

Benefits of Builder Pattern

    Readable Code:
    The client code becomes more readable and intuitive.

    Avoids Constructor Overloading:
    You avoid having multiple constructors for different object configurations.

    Immutable Objects:
    Ensures the immutability of the constructed object.

    Flexible Construction:
    Makes it easier to add new optional attributes without modifying the existing code.
