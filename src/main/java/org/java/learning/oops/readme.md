Keywords in Java:
Super, final, abstract, extends, implements, finally, static

The super keyword in Java is a reference variable that is used to refer to parent class when we’re working with objects.
The Keyword “super” came into the picture with the concept of Inheritance.



When a variable is declared with the final keyword, its value can’t be modified, essentially, a constant.




Wrapper Class: 

features of wrapper class - 
1. They convert primitive data types into objects. 
2. The classes in java.util package handles only objects and hence wrapper classes help in this case also.
3. Data structures in the Collection framework, such as ArrayList and Vector, store only objects (reference types) and not primitive types.
4. An object is needed to support synchronization in multithreading.
