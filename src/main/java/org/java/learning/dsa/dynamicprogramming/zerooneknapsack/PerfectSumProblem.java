/**
 * @Hint: same as subset sum problem but in this we need to calculate
 * @Problem: Statement
 * Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers and an integer sum,
 * the task is to count all subsets of the given array with a sum equal to a given sum.
 * Note: Answer can be very large, so, output answer modulo 109+7
 * @Example: 
 * Input: N = 6, arr[] = {2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10}
 * sum = 10
 * Output: 3
